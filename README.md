# Arachnoid
An Exporation game made in UE4.
This is a game made by a small group of five for a university project.

The majority of those working on this project are begginers at using unreal. 

We hope to provide players with an interesting time traversing an abandoned research facility.
As well as all the fun that comes along with being a tiny spy-bot, the player will also need to solve various puzzles while traversing the environment.
We hope that when done this will be a simple short game that is most importantly, fun and interesting to play.
